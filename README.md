Syracuse Parks & Art is a general overview of Syracuse parks, trails, sports fields/courts, community centers, and public art, put together from a mixture of data from the Syracuse Open Data project, as well as other information available online and compiled.

This site allows filtering and searching to tailor the map/results to the user's specific interests, and features information, images, and links for many locations.  It's both desktop and mobile friendly, and features geolocation which can show you your proximity to various points of interest if you're within the Syracuse city boundary.

This project was written in Typescript using the Vite React framework, the Google Maps API for mapping, and utilizes the AWS CDK for infrastructure.
